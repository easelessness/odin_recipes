    <h1>Lechon Manok Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/lechong-manok-9.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Litsong Manok or Lechon Manok is a classic Filipino chicken dish traditionally spit-roasted over hot charcoal. While this method does impart unbeatable fragrance and taste, it's not always feasible for the home cook.</p>
    <p>A turbo broiler does a fine job mimicking the tender, juicy, and golden lechon you can find at popular chain restaurants. You can also use the rotisserie function of your convection oven or roast in a conventional oven. Set the chicken on a roasting rack and NOT in a baking dish to allow heat circulation and to keep the rendered fat from pooling around the meat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (about 4 to 5 pounds)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup calamansi juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>4 shallots, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 stalk lemongrass</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove giblets and any extra fat from inside the chicken.</li>
        <li>Under cold running water, rinse chicken well and pat dry.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine calamansi juice, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir until sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and chopped shallots and stir to distribute.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the marinade and massage until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours to overnight, turning chicken a few times every 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator and drain from marinade, reserving marinade.</li>
        <li>With a knife, cut the thinner top portion of the lemongrass stalk and the very woody base.</li>
        <li>Peel off the tougher outer layers to get to the tender part of the stalk.</li>
        <li>With the back of a knife, pound the stalk a few times.</li>
        <li>Cut the lemongrass into about 3-inch lengths and stuff into the chicken cavity.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, bring the marinade to a boil for about 3 to 5 minutes or until reduced and thickened.</li>
        <li>Gently place the prepared chicken with the breast side down on the turbo broiler rack (use the lower metal rack).</li>
        <li>Brush the chicken liberally with the reduced marinade and broil at 180 C/350 F for about 20 to 30 minutes, Occasionally brush with marinade for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Carefully turn the chicken to breast side up and liberally brush with the marinade. </li>
        <li>Broil for about another 20 to 30 minutes or until a thermometer inserted at the thickest part reads 165 F. Occasionally brush with marinade for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Turn the temp up to 215 C/420 F and continue to cook for another 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is golden and nicely charred.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove from turbo broiler and place on a serving platter or chopping board, Allow to stand for about 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Humba (homba), which literally translates to tender (hum) pork (ba), is a Visayan braised pork dish similar to the classic adobo. It's said to have originated from the Chinese hong-bah/hong-mah, a red braised pork belly dish brought to the Visayas islands by Hokkien traders.</p>
    <p>In this regional version, pork belly is slow-cooked in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, or pineapple juice, and aromatics such as garlic, onions, peppercorns, and bay leaves. When the meat is fall-apart tender, palm sugar, pineapple, fermented black beans, and dried banana blossoms are added for extra depth of flavor and texture.</p>
